1. The mean temperature for June is 74.9 degrees and the mean temperature for December is 71 degrees. There is a 3 degree difference between the two months.
2. The minimum temperature experienced in June is 64 degrees, where the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees. 
3. The standard deviation for June is 3.25 and the standard deviation for December is 3.75, which means there is a .5 difference in the two months for the standard deviation. This means December has a wider spread for the temperatures experienced in that month.

## Summary
In summary, there is minimal difference between the temperatures in June and December. December does have a wider spread of temperatures experienced dipping to the colder end of things, but the average, percentiles and maximum are reassuring that the overall temperatures are comparable to each other. If you would like to gain an even deeper understanding of the viability for you surf and icecream shop, you also want to examine the precipitation as rain does deter many from surfing and going out for dessert. If you would like the precipitation data by month, please let me know and I will run that query and get those results to you as well.
